As the final project of my Full Stack Developer course, I designed and built a fully functional automated web application with a complete backoffice system, simulating a real-world production environment.

The application was developed using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL, following clean code principles and best development practices.

On the backend, I implemented MVC architecture in PHP, creating reusable controllers and models to manage authentication, users, and data operations. The database was designed with optimized SQL queries to ensure data integrity and performance.

Key features include:

- Full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete);
- Secure user authentication and session management;
- Backoffice system for managing application data;
- Support for a multi-user environment;
- Responsive UI with interactive components;

Security best practices were applied, including password hashing, SQL injection prevention, and session-based access control. This project strengthened my full-stack skills and demonstrates my ability to deliver a complete web application from architecture to production-ready code.
